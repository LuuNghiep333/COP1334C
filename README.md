# Password Validator
Write a program to validate user passwords based on certain rules. The program should prompt the user to enter a password and check if it satisfies the following conditions:
* The password must be at least 8 characters long and not exceed 20 characters.
* The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (e.g., @, #, $, etc.).
* The password should not contain spaces or any other characters outside the allowed set.
* The program should use strings to store the password and functions to validate it. It should provide appropriate error messages for passwords that fail to meet the criteria.
